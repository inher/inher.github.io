The participants of the arthropod courses got an opportunity to visit the lovely
campus of Symbiosis International University at Lavale, near Pune. This was
facilitated by Shilpa Avate, the biodiversity officer at Symbiosis, an avid
bird watcher and nature enthusiast herself. She is also the author of the
recently published book 'Fauna of Symbiosis University'.

The campus is spread over an area of 335 acres in the foothills of Sahyadri. It
still maintains quite a bit of native flora and fauna. The visit at the tail end
of monsoon season presented an opportunity to observe the wonder insect and
arthropod fauna of these lands. The highlight of the day were the amazing
praying mantis, stick insects, paper wasps building its nest, an ootheca (egg
case) of a praying mantis and numerous butterflies. Here are a few pictures from
the day.
